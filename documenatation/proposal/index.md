## Diagnostic inferencing via improving clinical concept extraction with DRL

Based on a patient medical record a model using DRL is able to help clinicians by suggesting
relevant topic. They were able to get a R@5 of 70% on the Wikipedia dataset, the paper contains
a baseline, the oracle is assumed to be a human doctor.

## AI Assisted Annotator using Reinforcement Learning

Using data from sensors of monitoring health devices (i.e heart rate), they created a model that has a F1 of 72.9% to classify non-alarms from critical alarms, no baseline was provided.
